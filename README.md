# WebOE-lexer
An HTML lexer written in C and C++. The PowerShell scripts are used to compile the code. GCC is required. Not compiled for other OSes yet. Feel free to create custom compilation code.
Syntax:
parser.exe -d (HTML code to be lexed)
parser.exe -f (Path to HTML file)

**INCOMPLETE. The -f flag hasn't been tested yet.**
